## Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹
I've recently committed to familiarizing myself with the AWS infrastructure and transitioning to Cloud. I've previously worked as an IT Support Technician & Frontend Developer. Over time I've gained skills in customer support, user administration, application development, and more.

Working as a freelance frontend developer during the pandemic has been a solid learning experience, whether it be learning how to structure my front-end projects and manage my time more effectively, or just learning new technologies for the job while improving on current skills. I was also exposed to working with REST API's and using React Context to manage external data.

## Current Certifications ðŸ“œ
I recently received the AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate certification, and may go for more AWS certs in the future.

### ðŸŒ± I'm also currently building some demo projects and looking to get hired!
I'm currently most familiar with the AWS stack, but I am open to using other platforms as well. 
I am open to a variety of roles within Cloud and engineering, so I'd love to have a conversation about any positions you think I'd be a fit for.
