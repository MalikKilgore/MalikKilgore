## Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹
I initially started out my career in multiple tech support jobs. As I was working in tech support, I taught myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript to learn the fundamentals of programming and web development. I eventually decided to learn more about cloud technologies and how to build out infrastructure using them. I've also learned fundamental networking & security principles through my college coursework.

In terms of programming, Iâ€™m currently familiar with a variety of languages and technologies including JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, and other miscellaneous development tools (Git/GitHub, Docker, etc.).

If you believe I'd be a good addition to your team, I'd love to have a conversation. Even though I am going through college, I am fully able to pursue full-time work thanks to the flexible schedule my program allows.
