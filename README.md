### Hey ðŸ‘‹
My name is Malik Kilgore and I'm currently a Front-End developer. I've been teaching myself how to code through self-study for the past year or so. I orginally studied during my free time at my last job, but eventually left so I could put all of my efforts into becoming a developer.
### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on VueChat
VueChat is a chat application that uses:
-Vue.js
-Firebase/Firestore as a backend database 
-VueX for state management
-Vue Router for extra page routing and checking authentication within the app
